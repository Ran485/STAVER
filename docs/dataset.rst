Example datasets
================

An ``staver`` workflow can be divided into the following two stages. We provide separate tutorials for each stage, using the quality control data as an example. 

We provide a tutorial for running the ``STAVER`` workflow on DIA-MS dataset with the ``Command-Line Interface (CLI)`` code.

To evaluated the robust generalization performance of the STAVER algorithm across diverse and large-scale DIA datasets,  we applied STAVER to a much more diverse and larger-scale  DIA dataset from the “ProCan-DepMap-Sanger project” (`Gonçalves, et al. 2022, Cancer Cell <https://doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2022.06.010>`_). We provide the comprehensive analysis of the PanCancer DIA-MS dataset, complete with detailed steps and corresponding code.
